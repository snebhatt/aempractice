# exc-app

Adobe Experience Cloud gives you everything you need to bring world-class experiences to every
customer. It consists of multiple solutions that power insights, content, engagement, commerce and
optimization.  The unified shell web application at
[https://experience.adobe.com](https://experience.adobe.com) provides a unified user experience for
customers to manage these solutions from a single place.

The solution experiences run within an iframe in the unified shell web application and can interact
with components of the unified shell such as topbar, menus, nps, alerts, etc. These interactions are
made possible through two components: -

1. A module-runtime script that is injected into the product iframe
2. This @adobe/exc-app package that provides an API to interact with the injected module-runtime
script.

## Getting Started

To get started with this integration, below two things need to be done.

1. Include the runtime loader script on the home page
2. Include the [@adobe/exc-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/exc-app) package in your NPM
`package.json` and invoke the init API.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {init} from '@adobe/exc-app';

init(runtime => {
  // Example initialization for a solution that uses React
  ReactDOM.render(<MyProductPage runtime={runtime} />, document.querySelector('#main'));
});
```
